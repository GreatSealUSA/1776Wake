# Year 1976 tie-in, 50 years

July 4, 1976 year 200   
July 4, 2026 year 250

Wish-list dream is to have people tie into "Fly like an Eagle" song lyrics and formation timing. Woodstock 1969 aftermath.    

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Like_an_Eagle_(song)

"The band first performed the song in 1973 while performing at New York City's Felt Forum on a bill with The Marshall Tucker Band, Buddy Guy, and Junior Wells."   

"The lyrics are slightly different, indicating that the place the eagle wants to fly away from is a Native American reservation."
