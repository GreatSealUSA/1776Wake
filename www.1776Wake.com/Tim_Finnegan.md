"Modern Freemasonry was established in England in 1717, although its exact origins are lost in the unrecorded history of medieval times. Its roots are found in guilds of stonemasons that, from the end of the 13th century, regulated the qualifications of stonemasons. As a stonemason grew in his craft, he was entered into the appropriate rank: apprentice, journeyman (now called Fellow Craft) and master mason."
 
"Tim Finnegan in the old vaudeville song was a hod carrier (a construction worker). “Bygmester” summons the ideas of “Big Mister,” Big Master,” but also “Master Builder,” a stone mason/architect (and a title in freemasonry). [The Master Builder is a play by Ibsen that Joyce references many times in the Wake]"
